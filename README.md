HEX is a program that allow you to modify the hex colors of your files in an easy and intuitive way using images.

## How does it work?
imaHEX will ask you to enter your file's location. Then it will create a two pixels-wide image containing all the colors in that file:
The first row is to keep track of the original colors, the second one is for you to edit the colors that you want to change.
After that it will ask you to press enter. And voil√†, your file has updated its colors.

## Notes
* It only works with 6-digit Hex Colors.
* Every color appears once.
