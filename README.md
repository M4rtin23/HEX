# HEX
HEX is a program that allow you to modify files containing 6-digit hex color codes using images.

# How does it work?
HEX will ask you to enter your file's location. Then it will create an image file of a width of 2 pixels and an undefined height:
The first column is to keep track of the original colors. The second one is for the colors that you want to change. Every color appears once.
After that it will ask you to enter the new image's location.
