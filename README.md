# imaHEX
ImaHEX is a command-line program that allow you to modify the hex colors of your files in an easy and intuitive way using images.

## How does it work?
ImaHEX needs the path to a file which contains hex-color values. Then it will create a two pixels-wide image containing all the colors in that file:
The first row is to keep track of the original colors, the second one is for you to edit the colors that you want to change.
The program will ask you to press enter when you are done. And after that it will update the colors of your file.

## Notes
* It only works with 6-digit Hex Colors.
* Every color appears once.
